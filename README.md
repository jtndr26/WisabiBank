## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gather ATM transaction data from the database or relevant sources.
   - Cleanse the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting inconsistencies.
   - Perform data transformations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating to prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Define Key Metrics and KPIs:**
   - Identify the key metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the business objectives and stakeholder requirements.
   - Metrics can include transaction volume, average transaction amount, transaction frequency, utilization rate, and average transaction duration.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Develop a data model in Power BI to establish relationships between different data tables, such as transaction data, ATM locations, customer demographics, and transaction types.
   - Create calculated columns and measures to derive additional insights from the data, such as year-over-year growth rates or percentage distributions.

4. **Visualization Design:**
   - Design visually appealing and insightful dashboards and reports using Power BI's wide range of visualization options.
   - Utilize charts, graphs, maps, and tables to present key insights effectively.
   - Ensure consistency in design elements such as color schemes, fonts, and layout across all visuals to enhance readability and user experience.

5. **Segmentation and Filtering:**
   - Implement interactive features like slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to segment data based on different criteria such as location, time period, transaction type, and customer demographics.
   - Enable users to explore data dynamically and gain deeper insights by interacting with the report visuals.

6. **Insights and Analysis:**
   - Provide meaningful analysis and insights derived from the data, highlighting trends, patterns, and anomalies.
   - Use descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and comparative analysis to uncover valuable insights that support decision-making and strategy development.

7. **Narrative and Commentary:**
   - Incorporate narrative elements and commentary to provide context and interpretation for the data visualizations.
   - Explain the significance of key findings, trends, and variations observed in the data to facilitate understanding for stakeholders.

8. **Iteration and Refinement:**
   - Continuously iterate and refine the report based on feedback from stakeholders and users.
   - Incorporate any additional requirements or modifications to enhance the report's effectiveness and relevance.

## **Result**: 

To develop a robust report on ATM transactions using Power BI, the initial step involves collecting and organizing transaction data from Wisabi Bank's database. This data must undergo thorough cleaning and formatting to ensure accuracy and consistency. Following this, a structured data model is created within Power BI, facilitating seamless analysis and visualization of transaction data. Relationships between various data tables, including transaction details, customer information, ATM locations, and transaction types, are established to enable comprehensive analysis.

Once the data model is set up, the dashboard design phase begins. The layout of the main dashboard is carefully crafted to present key metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) prominently. Visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and maps are strategically placed to provide a clear overview of ATM transaction insights. These visualizations enable stakeholders to gain valuable insights into transaction patterns, trends, and performance metrics.

In-depth transaction analysis is conducted to uncover insights into transaction patterns over time. Line charts are used to visualize trends in transaction volume and amounts across different time periods, allowing for the identification of any seasonal trends or patterns that may impact transaction activity. Additionally, location-based analysis is performed using maps and charts to analyze transaction data by ATM location, revealing high-performing locations and areas for improvement.

Demographic analysis further enriches the insights by examining transaction data based on customer demographics such as age group and gender. Visualizations are created to compare transaction frequencies, average transaction amounts, and preferred transaction types across different demographic segments. Moreover, transaction type analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of transaction types and the most common transaction activities.

Utilization rate analysis is essential for understanding the efficiency of ATM operations. Utilization rates for each ATM location are calculated and visualized, enabling the identification of factors contributing to high or low utilization rates. Interactive features such as filters, slicers, and drill-through capabilities are incorporated to empower users to explore transaction data dynamically, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.

Once the report is finalized, it is published to Power BI Service or shared with stakeholders via Power BI Desktop. Regular updates with new transaction data ensure that the report remains current and continues to provide actionable insights for Wisabi Bank's ATM operations and strategic initiatives.

## **Conclusion**:
The analysis of Wisabi Bank's ATM transactions using Power BI reveals valuable insights into transaction patterns, trends, and customer behavior. By examining transaction data across different dimensions such as time, location, and demographics, Wisabi Bank can identify opportunities to optimize its ATM operations, enhance customer experience, and tailor its services to meet customer needs more effectively. The comprehensive visualizations and interactive features provided by Power BI empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, driving efficiency improvements and strategic growth for Wisabi Bank in the competitive financial landscape of Nigeria.
